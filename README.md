# Coin Recognition Model (Corvidae)

This project is a convolutional neural network intended to recognize coin denominations from different currencies. The model is named "Corvidae" to symbolize its ability to recognize valuable items, much like crows, which are known for their attraction to shiny objects.

There are a total of 32 recognized currencies, and users can feed the model a 224x224 PNG image of a coin that they want to recognize, for which the model will return a label indicating its denomination.

The trained model itself is not currently uploaded to this repo due to GitHub file size limits.
